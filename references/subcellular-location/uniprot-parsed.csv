Mature form is secreted and released in the extracellular milieu by passing through the gasdermin-D (GSDMD) pore (PubMed:33883744).

Only a minor proportion is present at the cell membrane; most of the protein is present in intracellular vesicles (PubMed:20580937). During maturation, the immature APP (N-glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum) moves to the Golgi complex where complete maturation occurs (O-glycosylated and sulfated). After alpha-secretase cleavage, soluble APP is released into the extracellular space and the C-terminal is internalized to endosomes and lysosomes. Some APP accumulates in secretory transport vesicles leaving the late Golgi compartment and returns to the cell surface. APP sorts to the basolateral surface in epithelial cells. During neuronal differentiation, the Thr-743 phosphorylated form is located mainly in growth cones, moderately in neurites and sparingly in the cell body (PubMed:10341243). Casein kinase phosphorylation can occur either at the cell surface or within a post-Golgi compartment. Associates with GPC1 in perinuclear compartments.

Detected in the nucleolus after DNA damage. Acetylation at Lys-487 is essential for its nuclear localization. Within the nucleus, most of PML is expressed in the diffuse nuclear fraction of the nucleoplasm and only a small fraction is found in the matrix-associated nuclear bodies (PML-NBs). The transfer of PML from the nucleoplasm to PML-NBs depends on its phosphorylation and sumoylation. The B1 box and the RING finger are also required for the localization in PML-NBs. Also found in specific membrane structures termed mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) which connect the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the mitochondria.

SMC1A_HUMAN,SMC1A,"Nucleus. Chromosome. Chromosome, centromere, kinetochore. Note=Associates with chromatin. Before prophase it is scattered along chromosome arms.

At anaphase, the RAD21 subunit of the cohesin complex is cleaved, leading to the dissociation of the complex from chromosomes, allowing chromosome separation. In germ cells, cohesin complex dissociates from chromatin at prophase I, and may be replaced by a meiosis-specific cohesin complex. The phosphorylated form on Ser-957 and Ser-966 associates with chromatin during G1/S/G2 phases but not during M phase, suggesting that phosphorylation does not regulate cohesin function.

Cytoplasm, cytoskeleton, spindle pole. Cytoplasm, cell cortex. Cell membrane; Lipid-anchor; Cytoplasmic side. Lateral cell membrane. Note=Mitotic cell cycle- dependent shuttling protein that relocalizes from the interphase nucleus to the spindle poles and cell cortex (PubMed:1541636, PubMed:10811826). The localization to the spindle poles is regulated by AAAS (PubMed:26246606). In interphase, resides in the nuclear matrix (PubMed:1541630, PubMed:1541636, PubMed:23921553). In prophase, restricted to the interchromatin or condensed chromosome space (PubMed:10811826). In prometaphase, after nuclear envelope disassembly, forms aggregates both in the spindle midzone and at duplicated centrosomes and astral microtubules (MTs) of the bipolar spindle apparatus (PubMed:10811826). Translocates from the spindle midzone towards the spindle poles along spindle fibers in a MT- and dynein- dynactin-dependent manner until the anaphase onset (PubMed:1541636, PubMed:10811826). In metaphase, recruited to the polar cortical region in a GPSM2- and GNAI1-dependent manner (PubMed:23870127, PubMed:24109598, PubMed:24996901). Excluded from the metaphase equatorial cortical region in a RanGTP-dependent manner (PubMed:22327364, PubMed:23870127). Phosphorylation on Thr-2055 by CDK1 results in its localization at spindle poles in metaphase, but not at the cell cortex (PubMed:23921553). In anaphase, recruited and anchored at the cell membrane of the polar cortical region in a EPB41-, EPB41L2-, phosphatidylinositol-dependent and GPSM2- and G(i) alpha proteins-independent manner (PubMed:23870127, PubMed:24996901, PubMed:24109598, PubMed:24371089). Excluded from the anaphase equatorial region of the cell cortex in a RACGAP1- and KIF23-dependent and RanGTP-independent manner (PubMed:24996901). Associated with astral MTs emanating from the spindle poles during anaphase (PubMed:12445386, PubMed:24996901). Nonphosphorylated Thr-2055 localizes at the cell cortex, weakly during metaphase and more prominently during anaphase in a phosphatase PPP2CA-dependent manner (PubMed:23921553). As mitosis progresses it reassociates with telophase chromosomes very early during nuclear reformation, before substantial accumulation of lamins on chromosomal surfaces is evident (PubMed:1541636). Localizes to the tips of cortical MTs in prometaphase (PubMed:26765568). Localizes along MTs and specifically to both MT plus and minus ends (PubMed:26765568). Accumulates also at MT tips near the cell periphery (PubMed:26765568). Colocalizes with GPSM2 at mitotic spindle poles during mitosis (PubMed:11781568, PubMed:21816348). Colocalizes with SPAG5 at mitotic spindle at prometaphase and at mitotic spindle poles at metaphase and anaphase (PubMed:27462074). Colocalizes with ABRO1 at mitotic spindle poles (PubMed:26195665).

MRTFA_HUMAN,MRTFA,"Cytoplasm. Nucleus. Note=Subcellular location is tightly regulated by actin both in cytoplasm and nucleus: high levels of G-actin in the nucleus observed during serum deprivation lead to low levels of nuclear MRTFA, while reduced levels of nuclear G-actin result in accumulation of MRTFA in the nucleus (By similarity). G-actin-binding in the cytoplasm inhibits nuclear import by masking the nuclear localization signal (NLS) (By similarity). In contrast, binding to nuclear globular actin (G-actin) promotes nuclear export to the cytoplasm (By similarity). Nuclear localization is regulated by MICAL2, which mediates depolymerization of nuclear actin, which decreases nuclear G-actin pool, thereby promoting retention of MRTFA in the nucleus and subsequent formation of an active complex with SRF (PubMed:24440334).."
