SMC1A_HUMAN,SMC1A,"Nucleus. Chromosome. Chromosome, centromere, kinetochore. Note=Associates with chromatin. Before prophase it is scattered along chromosome arms.

In germ cells, cohesin complex dissociates from chromatin at prophase I, and may be replaced by a meiosis-specific cohesin complex. The phosphorylated form on Ser-957 and Ser-966 associates with chromatin during G1/S/G2 phases but not during M phase, suggesting that phosphorylation does not regulate cohesin function.

Note=Mitotic cell cycle- dependent shuttling protein that relocalizes from the interphase nucleus to the spindle poles and cell cortex (PubMed:1541636, PubMed:10811826). The localization to the spindle poles is regulated by AAAS (PubMed:26246606). In interphase, resides in the nuclear matrix (PubMed:1541630, PubMed:1541636, PubMed:23921553). In prophase, restricted to the interchromatin or condensed chromosome space (PubMed:10811826). In prometaphase, after nuclear envelope disassembly, forms aggregates both in the spindle midzone and at duplicated centrosomes and astral microtubules (MTs) of the bipolar spindle apparatus (PubMed:10811826). Translocates from the spindle midzone towards the spindle poles along spindle fibers in a MT- and dynein- dynactin-dependent manner until the anaphase onset (PubMed:1541636, PubMed:10811826). In metaphase, recruited to the polar cortical region in a GPSM2- and GNAI1-dependent manner (PubMed:23870127, PubMed:24109598, PubMed:24996901). Excluded from the metaphase equatorial cortical region in a RanGTP-dependent manner (PubMed:22327364, PubMed:23870127). Phosphorylation on Thr-2055 by CDK1 results in its localization at spindle poles in metaphase, but not at the cell cortex (PubMed:23921553). In anaphase, recruited and anchored at the cell membrane of the polar cortical region in a EPB41-, EPB41L2-, phosphatidylinositol-dependent and GPSM2- and G(i) alpha proteins-independent manner (PubMed:23870127, PubMed:24996901, PubMed:24109598, PubMed:24371089). Excluded from the anaphase equatorial region of the cell cortex in a RACGAP1- and KIF23-dependent and RanGTP-independent manner (PubMed:24996901). Associated with astral MTs emanating from the spindle poles during anaphase (PubMed:12445386, PubMed:24996901). Nonphosphorylated Thr-2055 localizes at the cell cortex, weakly during metaphase and more prominently during anaphase in a phosphatase PPP2CA-dependent manner (PubMed:23921553). As mitosis progresses it reassociates with telophase chromosomes very early during nuclear reformation, before substantial accumulation of lamins on chromosomal surfaces is evident (PubMed:1541636). Localizes to the tips of cortical MTs in prometaphase (PubMed:26765568). Localizes along MTs and specifically to both MT plus and minus ends (PubMed:26765568).
